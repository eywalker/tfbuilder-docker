# Unofficial TensorFlow Docker Images

Here you can find TensorFlow images based on Ubuntu 14.04LTS with Python 3.4. I have prepared both CPU (`:latest`) and GPU (`:cuda`) images with indicated tags. The most recently built images are made available at DockerHub at [eywalker/tensorflow](https://hub.docker.com/r/eywalker/tensorflow/).
